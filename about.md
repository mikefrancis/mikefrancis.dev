Currently Senior Developer at Benchmark studios, I'm an ex-northener, transplanted down south who is always learning but experienced at delivering all sorts of digital products.

My main expertise lies in the full LAMP stack and beyond, so I'm as comfortable writing Repositories in MVC frameworks as I am designing a UI. My bread-and-butter is WordPress, and I've been writing plugins in Object-orientated PHP and responsive themes in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript from scratch for most of my career.
