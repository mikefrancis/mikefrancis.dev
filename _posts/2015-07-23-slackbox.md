After moving to a new office and having to relinquish control of our music, we decided to get pro-active. We developed a Slack Command Integration to allow users to make collaborative Spotify playlists directly from Slack.

A couple of months after it's release, it has racked up over 200 stars on GitHub and was featured on [ProductHunt](http://producthunt.com) too.
